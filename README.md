Minotaur
********

Inspired by the classic paper and pencil game Hangman, Minotaur is a word guessing game that focueses on fantasy and greek mythology. The goal of the game is to guess the correct word before the Minotaur is summoned to attack you. Well normally Hangman is a two person game, this version is intended for one player.


How to play:
************

Choose one of the three categories that are prompted on the browser screen. Once the desired category is selected a word will be randomly be presented for the player to guess.

The player gets 10 attempts to select all of the correct letters before the Minotaur is fully summoned. Each incorrect letter selected will be displayed in the "Wrong Letter" box and a new Minotaur body part will be presented.

Each category that is availble corresponds to a difficulty level:

Mythical Places: Easy

Greek Gods: Average

Mythical Beasts: Hard


Issues and Challenges
*********************

The game is not compatiable with smaller screen windows or mobile devices. This is due to the image body parts not being responsive. This was dealt with by removing the image as the screen size decreased. This is an area of the game that could be potentially be addressed in the future by either making the image responsive to different windows or including an error message.

In the future, a div could be added at the beginning displaying instructions for the game. In addition, adding audio for when the user wins or loses could be benificial to the user experience and engagement.
